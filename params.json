Envision a world orbited by giant robots, satellite platforms for shenanigans and a terraformed moon that looks like our friendly soldier face logo! In this quest the OSD will utilize any technologies available to get there, using reverse-engineered technology from crashed UFOs â€” along with more mundane high-altitude balloons, rockets, and spaceplanes. With this, we will bring happiness and creativity to the stars, and build a Utopian Space Station! \r\n\r\n![TSOSD Shoulder](https://gs1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/8019B6/data.tumblr.com/f7e320ec214dd88d64101916616a4fa2/tumblr_n35obxtfR71t12h23o1_1280.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
